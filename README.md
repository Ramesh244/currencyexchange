Front-end:

Currency Conversion App: 

Language: ReactJS 

GOAL 

Develop a currency conversion web app.

TASK 

Create a web app that uses ReactJS as front-end to view the currency conversion rates for given currencies.
The application should contain the authentication pages (sign up, sign in and forgot password). Use the browser's local 
storage to store all the user details.

The source and target currencies should be definable in the front-end. There should be an option to select multiple 
target currencies for a single source currency.

Show all the conversion rates on the homepage. Users should be able to change target and source currencies.
The usage of functional components and hooks will be an added advantage. Validation should be handled properly. 
Bonus Tasks 

As a bonus task, include Google OAuth in sign in and sign up pages. Users can use Sign In with the Google option to 
skip authentication.

DELIVERIES 

A functional web app and a short text explaining your design decisions. In addition, the text should contain how you 
evaluated your results and ideas for further improvement (feel free to add mockups if required).
